# CryptoClustering_Module19
In this project, Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms are used to understand how 4 clusters of Cryptocurrencies show similarities in their classification.
To achieve this, I utilized cleaning and scaling method of the data and removed any outliers from the group. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) approach helped me in reducing the dimensions for the data, and further clustered them using the K-algorithm and finally, built visualizations with scatter plots.
It can be noted that the ideal number of K-4 was where the cluster value shows the most features.
